# Introduction to Search Indexes

This project is a toy project meant to illustrate how a search index works, and
how you can encode searchable "metadata" on the words of the text
(not metadata on the whole document). It's best to start reading in the javadocs
which can be built with `gradle allJavadoc` and viewed
at `build/docs/index.html`.

However, the code is meant to be read as well. Start
with `src/main/java/org/emerse/Index.java`, then perhaps the `Query` interface
and `TokenQuery` implementation.
